## 🔒 Cybersecurity Projects
# 🛡 Basic Vulnerability Scanner

A Python-based network vulnerability assessment tool designed to identify exposed services, analyze potential risks, and generate structured security reports.

This project demonstrates practical implementation of TCP-based port scanning, banner grabbing, service fingerprinting, and risk classification techniques commonly used in Security Operations and penetration testing workflows.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Multithreaded TCP port scanning
- Common service detection (FTP, SSH, HTTP, RDP, etc.)
- Banner grabbing for service fingerprinting
- Outdated service version detection
- Risk scoring and classification (Low / Medium / High)
- Structured JSON report generation
- Audit logging system
- Color-coded CLI output for improved readability

---

## 🧠 Technical Concepts Implemented

- TCP socket programming
- Concurrent execution using ThreadPoolExecutor
- Service version parsing and comparison
- Basic vulnerability classification logic
- JSON-based structured reporting
- Logging and audit trail implementation
- CLI argument handling using argparse
